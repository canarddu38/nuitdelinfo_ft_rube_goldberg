# ft_rube_goldberg

A simple but complex rube goldberg machine for the nuit de l'info
It runs on a **javascript nandgame like computer emulator** that runs **16 bit opcodes** compiled from an **assembly code** that runs **brainfuck code** which just writes `Hello, World!` to the standard input

`js(asm(brainfuck("Hello, World!")))`

## How to run?
copy paste the content of [code.asm](./code.asm) into [the emulator](https://github.com/virtualArch)

:warning: This should take ~2min up to 4min to write the text onto the screen :warning:

Based on my projet [virtual arch](https://github.com/virtualArch)
