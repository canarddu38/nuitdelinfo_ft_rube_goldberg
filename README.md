# ft_rube_goldberg

A simple but complex rube goldberg machine.
It runs on a **javascript nandgame like computer emulator** that runs **16 bit opcodes** compiled from an **assembly code** that runs **brainfuck code** which just tells `Hello, World!`

`js(asm(brainfuck("Hello, World!")))`

## How to run?
copy paste the content of [code.asm](./code.asm) into [the emulator](https://github.com/virtualArch)
:warning: This should take ~2min to write the text onto the screen :warning:
